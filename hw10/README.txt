EXTRA CREDIT

Based on the TimeQueue and UrgentQueue, every functions are double except push function, and the tq_hook and uq_hook are changed to int. Moreover, half of the functions in ElegantQueue are belong to time and others belong to urgent one. In Job_extra.cpp file, I changed the functions removeFromUrgent belong to urgent and removeFromTime belong to time.In Job_extra.h, I made one change on one private member variable to "ElegantQueue* ptr". In the main_extra, I also changed to the ElegantQueue pointers.
