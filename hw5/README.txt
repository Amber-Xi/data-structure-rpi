TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY:
Please be concise!  



ORDER NOTATION & EVALUATION:
What is the order notation of each of the member functions in your
class? Discuss any differences between the UnrolledLL, dslist, and STL
list classes. Evaluate the memory usage of your initial implementation
in the worst case. Give a specific example sequence of operations
where the data structure is inefficient. What is the average number of
elements per node in this case? 



EXTRA CREDIT:
Improved memory usage implementation.  Discussion as outlined in .pdf.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!
