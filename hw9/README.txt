HASH FUNCTION DESCRIPTION
I just put the title as the key. First, going over the movie book vector, if there is an empty spot, just return that spot. Otherwise, if matching the key, just return that one. If searching the vector, there is the same title, just linked the nodes with the same title to the back of that node.



HASH TABLE IMPLEMENTATION
The node class for me is the kind of movie object. Everytimes when I put the object in the  table, first checking the empty spot and linear linked list to that conflict object one, then go over to check.
